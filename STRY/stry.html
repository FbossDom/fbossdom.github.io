    Historical Time line:
        
    <p>In the 21st century a new space race began, nations, companies raced to secure to be the first to go further, faster, bolder than any of their competitors.
    This new race pushed the limits of science and engineering to the limits, breakthroughs happened in every escence of life.
    While many were sceptical about space exploration, after the first few years and trillions of dollars spent the people directly experinced the results 
    of these new discoveries. Life on Earth became better, more equal and overall easier for the regular folks.
    Issues like climate change, hunger and many other issues that were dominant in the early decades of the century simple vanished by the end of the 2080's.
    </p>
    <p>
    By the 2080's the resource allocation based capitalist system was already falling apart on earth, with basic needs being provided by almost every government and
    relief efforts took care of regions which refused to make power, food, water, and basic needs like medical care free for everyone. However companies had a
    great new playing ground in space to secure resources and territory.
    </p>
    <p>In the 2080's The entities(countries and companies) tried to secure the lands accross the solar system. However with the habitable spaces quickly being "captured"
    the sense of conflict rose up once more in Human history.
    2083 july 7 is the day when the one day war broke out, the BlueSky(bluesky is a company) spacecraft reached a free section of the Marsan surface, planning to 
    claim it for themselves, however the company Starblaze arrived at the same time, not being able to clearly decide who is the owner of the land the crewes of the
    two ships exchanged fire on the Marsan surface, many died and both ships were damaged. The Starblaze ship's reactor lost control and breached - 350 people were
    assigned to the two ships and within 2 weeks 90% of them died of radiation exposure the vessel made a large portion of the planet toxic with radiation,
    forcing already established communities to evacute. Leadership of both companies agreed that the battle was unnecesary, and not much after the treaty of Mars
    was founded - in this treaty all space faring entites had to agree to stop taking on more land with the 'i was here first' method and all future expeditions and
    expantions had to go through the newly founded Space Affairs office at the United Nations, comprised of representatives from each country.
    </p>
    <p>Only a few years later in 2088 the matter syntiseser was revealed by Dr Choi Jeane, and her team. This device used already widely accesible electical power provided by
    fusion reactors to create chemical elements directly from energy, and bonding these elements to create complex objects.
    With this change the need for industry almost dissaperd and money lost its meaning on earth.
    The change were not super smooth with having to deal with those that were rich already, but at the end everyone agreed that money is no longer needed.
    In the solar system besides earth soon the same followed however the transition was smaller and some hurried to exploit the working class as much as they can.
    By the end of the 21st century the situation has settled and humanity looked for a new goal, interstellar exploration.
    </p>
    <p>The first sucessful test of the new lightspeed capable drive was tested in 2104, and the version capable of 10 times the speed of light was showcased in 2110,
    in the same year an expedition to proxima centaury started planning. The flagship UNN Gaia started its journey towards proxima centaury in 2113.</p>
    <p>The following decades (2110's and 2120's) saw humanity establish colonies accross many of the nearby systems.</p>
    <p>The new UNN flagship the UNN - Discovery started its deep space journey in 2128 to survey systems and go furhter than anyone before</p>
