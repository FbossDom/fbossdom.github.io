Hello I'am Dominik FÃ¡bos, a Front-end Web Developer, and this is my first Portfolio. <br>

Built, using HTML5, SCSS and JavaScript. <br>
//Note that this project is not completeted//

- The Portfolio - /Unfinished/<br>
This is a very simple landing page with responsive design, two languages(HU / ENG), an email form using https://formsubmit.co/ and some animations. <br>
Nothing too special here, but everything is made by me and at the end im proud of the work i was able to do.

- Converter Dominium - /Unfinished/<br>
This is a simple JavaScript that converts any given value to a bunch of different scales. <br>
Currently only the "Length" part is operational - all the rest is just a copy / placeholder for the rest <br>

- New Realty - newrealtykft.hu - /only in hungarian/ <br>
This was my first published work(2021 october), i was asked through a friend to make a website for a construction / renovation / ect. company in Hungary. <br>
At first i wasn't sure i was up for it, but at the end both me and the client was satisfied with the result.

More Soon*
